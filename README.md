rip of emulatorjs demo using httrack just to mess around and throwing Mimi on the logos.

Might do more with it but mostly for messing around atm. Likely going to add better little emulator menu system and small little design things. 
Gonna practice making a docker file that has all the emulatorJS stuff for easy deployment of emulatorJS / a base framework since the normal docs suck
